# ROBO-PET

The **Pet Robot** is a smart ESP32-based autonomous robot designed to explore surfaces safely while displaying expressive OLED eyes. It avoids obstacles using an ultrasonic sensor and ensures it doesnâ€™t fall off edges using an IR surface detection sensor. Its behavior mimics that of a curious, cautious pet!

## Features

- **Obstacle Avoidance** using Ultrasonic Sensor  
- **Surface Edge Detection** using IR Sensor  
- **Animated OLED Eyes** that respond to motion and environment  
- **Smooth Motor Control** with PWM (adjustable RPM)  
- **Smart Navigation Logic** with intelligent turn and retry paths

## Logic Flow

1. **Forward Motion** until an obstacle or surface edge is detected.
2. **If Obstacle Detected:**
   - Stop â†’ Reverse â†’ Turn Left â†’ Check surface.
   - If surface not found â†’ Turn Right â†’ Move forward if clear.
3. **If No Surface Detected (Edge):**
   - Stop â†’ Reverse â†’ Try turning left and right until surface is found.
4. **OLED Eyes:**
   - Show idle animation by default.
   - Change eyes based on IR motion detection.

## ðŸ› Libraries Required

Install these libraries via Arduino Library Manager:

- `NewPing` â€” For ultrasonic sensor
- `U8g2` â€” For OLED animations

## Adjustments

- You can tune the motor speed by changing `speedValue` in the code (0â€“255).
- Adjust the delay timings in the navigation logic for smoother or faster reaction.
- OLED expressions can be customized to match your robot's personality.
